# CS698X Project: A Bayesian Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning

This repository contains the work that we did for the course project of *CS698X: Topics in Probabilistic Modeling and Inference* at IIT Kanpur. In this work, we try to implement the M2 model, the Blended model and the Bayes-Blended model as described in the paper - [Combining deep generative and discriminative models for bayesian semi-supervised learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003132031930456X).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source project that tries to implement the Blended and the Bayes-Blended models.
